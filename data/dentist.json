Much like Brahms's mastery over many musical disciplines - symphonies, concerti, chamber music, piano music, and choral compositions - Dr. Rabanus is a master of many dentistry disciplines. As other reviewers have mentioned, upon meeting him during your first appointment and evaluation, you immediately get the sense that he's an absolute professional. After all, he is the only cosmetic dentist in San Francisco accredited by the AACD. \n\nHowever, what impressed me the most was Dr. Rabanus's skill in dealing with unexpected situations. During my first session in the chair, two of my damaged old fillings came loose and nearly crumbled away, stalling prep work for the temporary veneers. Even though we were already several hours into the procedure, Dr. Rabanus didn't miss a beat. He immediately switched gears and began prepping and filling the oral cavity. After an hour finishing up this unexpected extra work, he transitioned back to the primary procedure without breaking a sweat. Incredible. And the fillings turned out better than the original ones! \n\nIn short, Dr. Rabanus effectively communicates a clear and concise dental plan while also allowing you to be part of the process. He encourages (and expects) you to be a part of the process - engaging you at every stage to help guide the outcome of your new \"look.\" \n\nI absolutely recommend and endorse the great work of Dr. Rabanus.

I always had crooked, gapped teeth and at a young age started developing cavities even with regular brushing and (occasional) flossing. As I got older, I started grinding my teeth in my sleep and ignored advice from multiple dentists over the years to sleep with a night guard. Over time the grinding looks its toll in a noticeable way and the enamel on my teeth was disappearing as well. I became very diligent about brushing and flossing multiple times daily, but continued having issues with cavities, yellowing, chips, and excessive wear. I went through two rounds of Invisilign which somehow made things worse since issues with the placement of my bite were never addressed, and I didn't wear a retainer for reasons I won't go into so my teeth weren't aligned for very long. Needless to say, I have always been self-conscious about them and worked hard to hide them when I smiled and when any pictures were being taken. \n\nIn late 2017, I began considering trying another round of Invisilign to straighten them again along with something like bonding to deal with the gaps, but I started to feel like I needed to make a more serious investment in a longer-term solution. This was when I turned to Yelp and started searching for a cosmetic dentist who could walk me through my options. I spoke with a couple of different dentists who were basically willing to do whatever I asked for, but then found the listing for Dr. Rabanus and read through all of the five star reviews. Not only was I intrigued, but I became emotional at the thought of finally finding a dentist who could provide an informed recommendation and help me achieve a healthy smile I could be proud of. I made an appointment for a consultation and met with him in January, 2018. \n\nTo jump right to the end, I ultimately got 20 veneers. This seemed extreme when the plan was first presented to me, but my teeth had deteriorated over many years and I knew a lot of work was needed. The roots were healthy and so were my gums so I didn't have to have any teeth totally removed or have other corrective work. I did some research to make sure veneers were the best route, and after more discussion with Dr. Rabanus felt confident that they were. He recommended I first have a \"gum lift\" (gingivectomy) to improve the look of my gum line since I had a very \"gummy\" smile and referred me to a periodontist. I had the gum lift done in March, then had to wait about six weeks for that to heal before we could proceed with the process for getting the veneers done. In the meantime, it was necessary to determine the appropriate placement for my bite since my teeth so I wore something called a deprogrammer for about four weeks. Once that was all done, the real work started and I ultimately ended up spending A LOT of time with Dr. Rabanus over the next several weeks as he worked diligently on providing me with an amazing smile. \n\nI don't think I need to go into how skilled and knowledgable Dr. Rabanus is. I think that's covered in many of the reviews here. What I will talk about is how dedicated he was to my case. He made me feel like I was his only patient by always being accessible and responsive, making appointments that were convenient for me, and spending countless hours with laser focus on making sure every tooth was dealt with in the best possible way. His precision and diligence was robot-like. I was very sensitive about how my bite felt and asked him to make a lot of tiny little adjustments, and he was more patient than any doctor or dentist has ever been with me. This was not an inexpensive endeavor and I had a lot of hesitation spending the amount of money I ultimately did for this work, but in the end it was worth it and I am thrilled with the outcome. I still check in with Dr. Rabanus from time to time and very recently reached out about a concern with one of the teeth. He responded quickly as always, made time for me, and quickly took care of the issue.

Up front communication/Listening - Dr. Rabanus listens to your specific needs, takes the time to answer your questions in up front consultation (many of mine were related to process/technology), and even did a photoshop mock up of my potential smile post-op. Other doctors I talked to were not as patient or willing to go in-depth with me. Additional bonus is he is very flexible to your schedule and works nights/weekends. He will make you feel confident going in.\n\n2. Quality - I have had the veneers for ~one year now and have had 0 \"non-aesthetic\" issues. No chips, no pain, no speech/breathing alteration, no bite issues, etc. Of course we all do this for cosmetics but can't take this aspect for granted. I have friends who have had pain/gum issues with other doctors.\n\n3. Design/Aesthetics - Dr. Rabanus clearly has an eye and passion for design and knows how to create a beautiful smile. He does not just put a \"cookie cutter\" mold on you and will incorporate your feedback and make modifications to temporaries to get the exact look you want. That said, it is best to work with him having a decent idea of what you want (do your own studying), as he is hesitant (rightfully so) to answer questions on \"what would look better\" and ultimately forces you to make your own decisions.\n\nCost was higher than all the others I consulted with but not egregious and I believe worth the premium that is ultimately not material when you're talking about a multi-year investment.", "language": "en", "isFunnyCount": 0, "isUsefulCount": 0, "isCoolCount": 0, "photoUrls": [], "reviewerName": null, "reviewerUrl": null, "reviewerReviewCount": 70, "reviewerLocation": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"date": "2017-11-11T00:00:00.000Z", "rating": 5, "text": "Dr. Rabanus is amazing.

We all ended up talking about online dating and how the new patient and his girlfriend were an online dating success story. \n\nThe new patient had the Ivoclar Vivadent color shade guide with him and some other materials, so he was looking at color selection homework and had just completed some impressions. His girlfriend looked a little nervous about her boyfriend getting cosmetic dentistry and it it looking really fake. Just dumb luck that the consultation had run a bit long into my appointment and I ended up being a living model of Dr. Rabanus' finished work. \n\nThe new patient asks me, point blank, \"if you don't mind my asking, are those veneers?\" and I replied \"well, they're crowns but the look would be the same\" and he goes \"Wow. Those look REALLY good. I want my teeth to look exactly like yours. The shape, color, length, everything.\"\n\nThe concerned look on his girlfriend's face immediately melted away.

I don't. So, after years of listening to dentists gently push me towards getting (expensive) porcelain veneers - and spending thousands on bonding that inevitably would discover or crack - I finally decided it was time. Shopping around, I found that each dentist had his or her own \"plan\" on how to go about it, none of which felt right to me. I can't explain why.\n\nI finally turned to my wife and said, \"If I'm going to do this, I want to find the BEST.\" So we turned to Yelp and discovered a cosmetic dentist whose reviews didn't seem real. 5 Stars across the board? Come on. Unless Dr. Jorg-Peter Rabanus has a second career as a writer capable of writing convincingly in many different voices, it seemed like I found my guy. I chose to make the next move and see if the proof was in the potato salad. \n\nWe met Dr. Rabanus at his office in downtown San Francisco. I have never had a doctor unafraid to be a real person with me, and I appreciated this (we now text to make appointments). But more so, I appreciated his deep understanding of my mouth. He had seen my x-rays before I arrived and developed a clear plan of attack for me that just made sense. Way more sense than any other dentist I'd consulted in the past. No braces needed (others said I would). A realistic 3-4 month timeline to take care of roughly... my whole mouth. And an understanding that I won't just get new teeth that look great, I'll also have the opportunity to correct my jaw and \"reset\" my mouth to its most natural home position. Never heard this one before. \n\nDr. Peter is not just a dentist. He is currently the only cosmetic dentist in San Francisco who is accredited by the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, as well as a professor on the subject dedicated to teaching other dentists worldwide. He won't mention most of his accolades in person, but just read: aesthetic-dentistry.com/\u2026. \n\nPeople fly in from all over the world to work with Dr. Peter for a reason. His attitude and professionalism are nice bonuses. The main reason is he's a master of his craft. I can say this with full confidence now after having recently completed my full consultation schedule with him. From wearing a \"deprogrammer\" for a month to set my jaw in the home position, to not experiencing any pain after nearly 6 hours in the dentists chair, you need to understand that this guy is legit. Your mouth is going to thank you. \n\nI don't always take the luxury path. I'm often totally fine buying the cheap option, as long as it serves my needs. I don't need the world to see that I drive a BMW, if I'm totally happy with a Ford. That said, for the things I use every day, like a bed or my teeth, I want a BMW. And Dr. Peter is the BMW of dentists. What the world now sees is the result of his German precision in carefully orchestrating and executing a rebuild of my mouth that now has me smiling brighter and receiving smiles just as big in return. My confidence was never low, but oh man... I didn't realize it can be boosted like this. Only problem now is that my wife is more nervous about other women looking at me! ;-) \n\nThanks, Dr. Peter.

I said, because I went to the dentist for regular cleaning two weeks ago and they confirmed that I do. She then asked \"why wouldn't you get them filled there?\" Oh, I am sorry - I am bringing you more business but you are questioning why I am at your office?
