There could be no doubt it is fresh and not from concentrate. It might be too good, meaning too strong, for some palates. I split the plant based lamb pita and the traditional sabich pita. Both were excellent. The sweet potato fries were a shared dish and enjoyed by all, ranking among the best ever of that dish supposedly a healthier alternative to conventional fries. \n\nThe portions were good, not too much.

The roasted beets, my favorite of the three salads, was sweet, tangy, and refreshing. The quinoa tabouli provided a strong dose of parsley and mint, which I appreciated since I like herby flavors.

Our group of 4 shared:\n\n- MELITZANOSALATA (excellent sampler of fresh spreads, must try the roe dip!)\n- HALLOUMI STO FOURNO (MY fav-- savory, crispy, AND tart with fresh pomegranate)\n- OCTAPODAKI TOU YIORGOU (very smoky, super tender)\n- PSARI PSITO (rotates, this was some type of sweet whitefish)\n- KOTOPOULO SOUVLAS (flavorful, succulent-- a whole meal in itself)\n\nOther than your basic gyros, souvlaki, general ambiguously Mediterranean-inspired dishes, I've had no other exposure to Greek food-- Kokkari was a lovely introduction to their finer fare.

Pretty fancy atmosphere and really really great service. Also a delicious selection of greek wine... recommend getting a bottle of santorini wine to share with the table! As for the food itself:\n\n-Zucchini Cakes (5/5): these are some of my favorite greek apps and these were so good! The dip it came with was thick yet light and the zucchini cakes themselves were stuffed with zucchini, not oily or over fried at all, and you were definitely able to see and taste the thin shreds of zucchini\n\n-Spanakotiropita (3/5): very flaky and flavorful, but a little much on the cheese side (overpowering the other great ingredients inside)\n\n-Octopus (4/5): succulent, charred, flavorful. a little too generous with the olive oil though. On par with other delicious octopus I have had before\n\n-Dip platter (2.5/5): honestly a bit disappointing. the pita was not warm and the only dip I really enjoyed, although it was slightly thicker and heavier than usual, was the tzatziki.\n\n-Sea Bass (3.5/5): I thought the fish was really good. the skin was so thin and crisp and honestly stole the show. The fish could have been slightly more tender though and it did get a little old... maybe a couple more sides other than just boiled greens could have been nice to complement the flavors of the fish\n\n-Yiaourti Granita (5/5): wow SO GOOD. did not expect this dessert to be so light, tart, and flavorful. the yogurt sorbet was thicker than I expected (more of an ice cream consistency) but it was so light and tart in flavor. It paired so well with the refreshing fruit sorbet. The dessert also came with a delicious, slightly sweet candied nut shell that was so thin, light and flavorful and honestly was so fun to break it apart and eat it by itself or with the sorbet!!

The beef dumplings were great as well; the flavor reminded me a bit of Italian meatballs. \n\nThe entrees were decent, although not as good as the apps IMO. We had the tahdig, which came with saffron rice and duck breast. The rice was flavorful, but while tender, the duck breast was too salty. We also had the chicken skewers, which were tender, but lacked the same depth of flavor as the other dishes. \n\nOverall enjoyable experience here with good vibes!", "language": "en", "isFunnyCount": 0, "isUsefulCount": 0, "isCoolCount": 0, "photoUrls": ["https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWucr5OlDBswG706w9Gi8A/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u58qsGPnUkxcVkhdqlQAZA/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3TMCDXQGSA4BxXOPPrDItg/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I2pmXJZV-ilP5wyKsoSUNQ/o.jpg"], "reviewerName": null, "reviewerUrl": null, "reviewerReviewCount": 294, "reviewerLocation": "Berkeley, CA"}, {"date": "2023-02-19T00:00:00.000Z", "rating": 4, "text": "My colleagues and I had a team dinner at this classy Mediterranean venue with reservations at 6 pm on a Monday night! The place was moderately packed with groups and couples! Let's dive in :) \n\nAMBIENCE: The atmosphere of the restaurant was ideal with ambient lighting, trendy decor, and great seating from high tables, bar seating, or regular tables. The vibe was energetic as everyone was enjoying their time together in group or one to one conversations. The acoustics were great despite how loud everyone was getting throughout the night. Classy and professional was the spotlight quality of the restaurant.\n\nSERVICE: The service was fast, traditional restaurant since their waiters had pen and paper to write down our orders instead of an electronic device. Our waiter was patient as not our entire group was present, but gave us quality service in recommendations for their speciality drinks. The waiter was professional since some of us were waiting on our drinks, so he explained how the bar is backed up and thanked us for our patience. \n\nORDERS: We had a pre-set menu that gave us full exposure of Barcha's delicacies. \n\n-Barcha's Gin and Tonic: refreshing and light dish that wasn't overpowering on the alcoholic flavor. The drink was a sight to see with the pristine color, the scent of lemon, and interesting with the spices included. I enjoyed the drink throughout the night with its complex flavors from sweet and spice. \n\n-Pita Bread: large stack of bread that everyone loved to cleanse their palates throughout the night. \n\n-Falafels: great presentation with array of vegetables decorating the appetizers. The combinations of garlic, dill, cucumber, and tahini were a nice explosion of flavors with the exterior being crunchy. Somewhat of a gritty aftertaste, but I enjoyed it. \n\n-Fattoush Salad: Excellent medley of spring vegetables \u00a0that were refreshing and the bitterness amplified the sweetness from the pomegranate. The feta cheese was great for that salty, savory factor. Good dish to whet our appetites for the main entrees. \n\n-Seared Salmon: It was my least favorite dish of the night; it tasted still fishy and a bit too salty. The skin was a bit too chewy and the vegetables splattered on the fish were soggy. \n\n-Grilled Chicken Kebob: This was everyone's favorite dish of the night from what I recall. Great char on the meat that gave its smoky and crunchy flavor. Very filling. The chicken was tender, juicy, and was seasoned well with caram\u00e9lized onions, tahini yogurt, and pepper. \n\n-Baklava: lovely presentation and bite sized and a savory way to end the night. Lots of crunch and flaky pastries. \n\nRATING: Great restaurant that was a highlight of my week!", "language": "en", "isFunnyCount": 1, "isUsefulCount": 3, "isCoolCount": 3, "photoUrls": ["https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0mjw9ekTGlQJd9pJAVmDYQ/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DQAcRgXr_cdQ5WSTA2u9XQ/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hgbMowY_S1s1abExwxvXoQ/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OV9MBXh0a86fIW0cOYC8Wg/o.jpg"], "reviewerName": null, "reviewerUrl": null, "reviewerReviewCount": 192, "reviewerLocation": "San Jose, CA"}, {"date": "2023-02-20T00:00:00.000Z", "rating": 4, "text": "Great ambiance and food, though definitely pricey. My friends and I came here on a Tuesday night with a reservation, and were seated at a table outside. They actually have heaters that keep you warm outside unlike some places where the heat is really limited. We were super cozy at our table :)\n\nUpon being seated we were brought water, and then had a chance to look at the menu. It took some time for them to take our order and we did have to flag someone down to do so. Between the 4 of us we decided to get the spiced beef dumplings, kabocha squash hummus, grilled chicken kebab, and persian tahdig. The appetizers were quite good with the hummus being a unique flavor and the dumplings having a somewhat Italian-like flavor? For the entrees, I loved how tender the chicken was though we all found the tahdig to be a tad salty, and the rice wasn't as crispy as we hoped. I did enjoy getting to taste a little bit of everything and since I don't have Mediterranean food too often, I wasn't even sure what I was eating to be honest. I just knew it was delicious.\n\nIf you're looking for a nicer place with great vibes I would definitely recommend this spot.
