The other place on Larkin, TT went down hill. We had the #7 house special pho $16.50 large, #35 mi trieu chau (dry egg noodles) $14.50 medium and bo tai chanh (beef carpaccio) $18. Pho Tan Hoa is well worth the trek into the TL. The broth, meat, quality of the noodles, service are all excellent. \n\nNote, the weird people in the TL are worst now in 2022 than 2021. This was at noon on a Friday.", "language": "en", "isFunnyCount": 5, "isUsefulCount": 12, "isCoolCount": 7, "photoUrls": ["https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B5eKbaGr8npH0LxeU772AQ/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L346Sy_YmEDlyvATfVk0uQ/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vcwXHE3ymO6Pcp9BAyOt1A/o.jpg"], "reviewerName": null, "reviewerUrl": null, "reviewerReviewCount": 465, "reviewerLocation": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"date": "2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z", "rating": 4, "text": "Pho Tan Hoa Ratings: 4.4/5\n\nFood: 5/5 - I'm glad we are trying out a new Vietnamese restaurant each week in the Tenderloins and found Pho Tan Hoa this week. This place surprised me with their dry pho dish, and it hits the spot on every level, so interesting and unique! Please see the description of the entrees we got, because you definitely do not want to miss out on this one. \n\n- Dac Biet Pho Kho [GET]: I got their famous dry pho at Pho Tan Hoa, and rare to find at most Pho places in SF. It comes with well-done brisket, flank, tendon, and rare slice of steak. Love the roasted peanuts garnished on the top. They provide a bowl of soup and chili dipping sauce on the side, but I prefer the latter because it added some acidity, spicy and that tangy kick to the dish. The noodles are surprisingly flavorful and well-seasoned. I think it is seasoned in soy sauce, cooking wine, sesame oil etc., so delicious and not heavy at all. \n\n- Pho Xe Lua Tan Hoa [GET]: The classic house special beef noodle soup with well-done brisket, flank, tendon, and rare slice of steak was solid and the meat are tender. They give you an abundant amount of meat and noodles. The beef broth is hearty, but is a bit bland and I wish it had more of a stronger beefy flavor to it. The broth that comes with the dry pho was a lot more flavorful. The noodle is cooked just right, not too soggy or hard. My boyfriend think its a good pho, but not the best we've had. \n\nAmbiance: 4/5 - There are so many homeless people in the neighborhood, probably the worst location I've been to in the Tenderloins. The interior is very clean, bright, and simple though, bathroom is better than I expected, and I love how spacious it is. The chopsticks, spoons, and saucer were clean as well. Great place for a causal lunch if you live in the area, but they do close early since they are in a sketchy area. \n\nPrice: 4.25/5 - The large beef noodle soup bowl and the dry pho was both $14.85 before tax (recently increased their prices). The total came up to be around $38 after tax and tips for the both of us. Portions are huge and generous, bigger the other Pho places nearby. Great value still, and they only take CASH but there's an ATM machine available if you don't. \n\nService: 4.25/5 - Service is what you expect at an Asian restaurant. The staffs here are fast and efficient. Our server come to our table, took our order, and the food comes out within like 10 minutes. They come once to fill your water glass, but after that they will leave you alone, which is great. The lady was super nice and explained to me the in and out of that dry pho dish, so I was convinced. It was an great experience. \n\nBLUF: Another authentic Viet place in the Tenderloins. There's a ton of options on the menu, and I would suggest coming to Pho Tan Hoa for the Dry Pho, definitely something worth trying. The prices here are higher than other places, but it was still good. I would skip on the regular beef pho, unless you like broth on the blander / lighter side.", "language": "en", "isFunnyCount": 0, "isUsefulCount": 1, "isCoolCount": 2, "photoUrls": ["https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7zozw-QT1PI6BSv9IKoMgQ/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rlJZlrHiw3CH6eOj-2kFng/o.jpg"], "reviewerName": null, "reviewerUrl": null, "reviewerReviewCount": 558, "reviewerLocation": "Richmond, VA"}, {"date": "2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "rating": 5, "text": "For when you need that bowl of hot soup on a rainy day (even for breakfast).
