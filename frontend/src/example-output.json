The tuna with caviar on top of this toast was also so bomb and never had anything like it before - very unique.\"; \"Many of the otsumami were a delight- unexpected flavors, a variety of textures, a more modern approach to sushi in general. The milk toast was to die for and we absolutely loved the wagyu dumpling.\"; \"The fried fish was flavorful, crispy, and the meat was sweet. The tuna and caviar over the toasted bread was so buttery, savory, and crispy!\"; \"Fish was immaculate and omg the best green tea ice cream ever! Packed with green tea flavor and super creamy!\"",

SF fine dining has a habit of being too slow, too fast, or too in-your-face, but the service here was perfect. Water glasses/sake always full, dishes always perfectly timed and at the right temp, and servers were informative and attentive.\"; \"Knocking one star off only because they overcharged me for one supplement I ordered 3 of and they counted as 4, and also if you're seated at the corner it can be a little difficult getting the chef's attention, but in spite of these couple of hiccups I still love this place and will definitely be back.\"",
